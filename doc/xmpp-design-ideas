Assume we use XMPP/Jabber for communications/networking/multiplayer-support.

We need a Jabber server that supports Multi-User Chat (MUC).

ejabberd is one such server.

The easiest thing to do would be to:

- create a new MUC per poker table 
- create a "referee bot" that administers the MUC
- the client sends actions on behalf of the players as messages to the MUC
- the referee bot takes these actions and updates the state of the game
- the referee bot sends messages to the clients in the MUC with game events as they happen
- clients receive these messages and update the user interface on the client to match
- the referee sends a private message to each client for dealing hole cards


there's some concern [1] about using MUC for everything however.

review [2] as well ...
